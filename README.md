# MV(AP)P

MV(AP)P, funny short for most valuable application, generates a ranked list of
currently installed iOS app on your devices based on their release or purchase
date. The idea is that the older an app for you is and still installed on your
device, it should be of high value for you as it's assumed you still use it
(built-in apps from Apple are obviously excluded as can't be purchased,
luckily).
